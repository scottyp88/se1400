        <h2>Website Summary:</h2>
        <h4>What content will the site contain?</h4>
            <p>Info and reviews about different pieces of Gear related to shooting
                    from a lens of hunting and precision shooting, along with insights not related to gear</p>
        <h4>Where will you get all of the content for your site?</h4>
            <p>I will draw upon my own experiences while referencing different people from forums and people I know personally.
                        Images will come from stock photos, my own photos, and when/if possible photos fram manufactures or retailers.</p>
        <h4>Why should users care about the focus of the site?</h4>
            <p>Honestly they shouldn't I am a random person that loves hunting and shooting along with the details behind it 
                        however, I am no expert and don't claim to be so if they listen that's on them.</p>
        <h4>Why should a site be built for this?</h4>
            <p>There isn't really a reason to build a site like this but I guess it can be kinda fun so here it is. </p>
        <h4>What would you like users to do at your site?</h4>
            <p>Look at the information I provide and take what they would like from it and also help me to get better as a hunter and a shooter.</p>
        <h4>What is the goal of the site?</h4>
            <p>Get information I have learned on paper or in this case on the web.</p>
