                <h4>Geolocation</h4>
                <p>Location doesn't matter as much but the Western United States will be catered to more than anyone else due to that being my experience.</p>
                <p>While it doesn't matter specifically where people are located you do begin to run into issues with certain states that like to restrict the rights of the people who live there specifically like California. 
                    This makes begins to make things difficult if I am trying to sell certain item such as leaded ammo, suppressors, or other things that the California government decides is bad.</p>

                <h4>Age</h4>
                <p>12-30 year olds 12 being the age to big game hunt in Utah and 30 being one of the older ages I feel I can still relate with through experiences.</p>
                <p>Again like was talked about in the Geolocation portion of the audience certain states again California restrict websites from allowing individuals younger than 18 years old when specifically 
                    websites that sell firearms which this site wouldn't specifically do but could definetly in the future sell items adjacent or technical firearms like suppressors aka silencers. This makes it hard to meet the age range of audience I am trying to target.
                    This may be able to be solved by keeping the information/blog portion open to anybody that is interested why asking whether a visitor to the shop portion of the page is over the age of 18.
                    While I would prefer to just have it completely open that is probably the best compromise I could come up with.</p>

                <h4>Gender</h4>
                <p>The majority of Hunters and Shooters are men. I am also a man so that will be the natural audience.</p>
                <p>The above statement is just going off the facts. While I think that the world could definetly benefit from more women hunters the majority of hunters and shooters are men.
                    I specifically would not cater to the former military section of the shooting and hunting community because there are plenty of really good people in that space and I have zero experience in that field.
                </p>
                <h4>Other</h4>
                <p>The main audience I want are people that care about hunting and shooting and care about the gear they use for those.</p>
                <p>This is the most important thing that I care about is being able to provide quality information to people that really want to learn more about hunting and shooting and the 
                    gear that goes into it.
