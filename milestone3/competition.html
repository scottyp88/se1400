        <h4>IMPACTSHOOTING</h4>
            <p>Does a solid blend of different aspects of shooting like PRS, Varmint Hunting, and Big Game Hunting.</p>
            <p>In a lot of ways he is talking about and using things that are not attainable for a majority of people which is a plus and a minus.</p>
            <p>I would be talking about the things that are available to me as well as things that I don't have but am very interested in.</p>

        <h4>GOHUNT</h4>
            <p>Goes deep into hunting gear and is successful as a hunter</p>
            <p>Seems to be very lacking in terms of shooting knowledge and gear knowledge related to rifles</p>
            <p>Being able to bridge the gap between hunting skill and shooting knowledge would be better</p>
        
        <h4>Texas Predator Hunting Podcast/Ally Munitions</h4>
            <p>Delves into rifles especially made for hunting Varmints and Predators and the ballistics of these</p>
            <p>Does not seem to have much knowledge on most big game hunting especially Western States hunting like elk, mule deer, bighorn sheep, and mountain goats</p>
            <p>Utilize a more similar format however talk more about Western Hunting</p>
