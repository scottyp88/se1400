                <h4>IMPACTSHOOTING</h4>
                <p>Does a solid blend of different aspects of shooting like PRS, Varmint Hunting, and Big Game Hunting.</p>
                <p>In a lot of ways he is talking about and using things that are not attainable for a majority of people which is a plus and a minus.</p>
                <p>I would be talking about the things that are available to me as well as things that I don't have but am very interested in.</p>
                <p>This biggest thing that I feel I would have an advantage in over Impact Shooting is that I am in the United States specifically the western United States where he is in South Africa. Which may not be an advantage if people are interested in South African Game or just shooting tips.</p>

                <h4>GOHUNT</h4>
                <p>Goes deep into hunting gear and is successful as a hunter</p>
                <p>Seems to be very lacking in terms of shooting knowledge and gear knowledge related to rifles</p>
                <p>Being able to bridge the gap between hunting skill and shooting knowledge would be better</p>
                <p>The main advantage I feel like I would have is I don't have to make money because I don't have any employees and this isn't a real company. That is also a disadvantage because if I did want to make it a company it would be more difficult</p>

                <h4>Texas Predator Hunting Podcast/Ally Munitions</h4>
                <p>Delves into rifles especially made for hunting Varmints and Predators and the ballistics of these</p>
                <p>Does not seem to have much knowledge on most big game hunting especially Western States hunting like elk, mule deer, bighorn sheep, and mountain goats</p>
                <p>Utilize a more similar format however talk more about Western Hunting</p>
                <p>The biggest advantage that I think I would have is that I am not beholden to sponsors or my own company as far as ammo so I can try whatever and tinker with whatever and there is not really a consequence to it.</p>
