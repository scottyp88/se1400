                    <h4>Why should users care about the focus of the site?</h4>
                        <p>Honestly they shouldn't I am a random person that loves hunting and shooting along with the details behind it 
                            however, I am no expert and don't claim to be so if they listen that's on them.</p>
                    <h4>Why should a site be built for this?</h4>
                        <p>There isn't really a reason to build a site like this but I guess it can be kinda fun so here it is. </p>
