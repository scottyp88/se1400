        <h4>Geolocation</h4>
            <p>Location doesn't matter as much but the Western United States will be catered to more than anyone else due to that being my experience.</p>

        <h4>Age</h4>
            <p>12-30 year olds 12 being the age to big game hunt in Utah and 30 being one of the older ages I feel I can still relate with through experiences.</p>
        
        <h4>Gender</h4>
            <p>The majority of Hunters and Shooters are men. I am also a man so that will be the natural audience.</p>
        
        <h4>Other</h4>
            <p>The main audience I want are people that care about hunting and shooting and care about the gear they use for those.</p>
